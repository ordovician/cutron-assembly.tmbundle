# Calcutron-33 Assembly Bundle for TextMate

This is a TextMate Bundle to help developing stuff in Calcutron-33 Assembly used by the made-up Calcutron-33 microprocessor, designed for teaching beginners to assembly programming.

## Installation

The recommended way to install bundles is to use Git so you can update the bundle easily. To do so, open a Terminal, change to your bundle location and clone this repository:

    mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/Avian/Bundles
    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Avian/Bundles
    git clone git://github.com/ordovician/cutron-assembly.tmbundle

Alternatively you can also download the source as Zip or Tarball, extract it and place it into the bundle location noted above.

The above commands assume you're using TextMate 2. In case you still have TextMate 1.x, then you have to use the bundle location

    ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles

instead of `~/Library/Application\ Support/Avian/Bundles`.

If you're using TextMate 1 you should reload the bundles in TextMate using *Bundles -> Bundle Editor -> Reload Bundles*.
